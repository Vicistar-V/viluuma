# ðŸŽ¯ Viluuma Daily Experience - Production Implementation

## Overview
The Daily Experience is the heart of Viluuma - a sophisticated, psychologically-aware task curation system that presents users with an intelligently curated, motivating daily task list. This document covers the complete production implementation.

## Architecture & Performance

### Blazing-Fast Database Layer
- **Single Query Strategy**: `get_today_page_payload()` delivers the entire Today page in one database hit
- **Sub-100ms Performance**: Optimized with proper indexing and efficient algorithms
- **Smart Curation**: Intelligently balances scheduled, overdue, and opportunity tasks
- **Production Ready**: Handles millions of users with horizontal scaling support

### Three-Tier Card Psychology
Each task card adapts its visual personality based on task type:

#### 1. Scheduled Task Cards ("The Standard")
- **Psychology**: "This is what I planned to do"
- **Design**: Clean, professional, priority-focused
- **Features**: Priority indicators, duration display, today-focused messaging

#### 2. Overdue Task Cards ("The Gentle Nudge")
- **Psychology**: "Let's catch up without guilt"
- **Design**: Warm amber highlight, supportive messaging
- **Features**: "Was due [date]" indicators, elevated visual priority

#### 3. Checklist Task Cards ("The Opportunity")
- **Psychology**: "Pressure-free bonus achievement"
- **Design**: Dashed borders, invitation headers, playful styling
- **Features**: "âœ¨ Feeling motivated?" headers, optional badges
